Sure! Let's go through the code line by line and explain each part:

```cpp
#include <OneWire.h>
#include <DallasTemperature.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>
#include <EEPROM.h>
#include <PID_v1.h>
```
- These are include directives, which include necessary libraries for the code to compile and function properly. 
- `<OneWire.h>` and `<DallasTemperature.h>` are libraries for interfacing with DS18B20 temperature sensors.
- `<Wire.h>` is the library for I2C communication.
- `<LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>` is a library for controlling LCD displays via I2C.
- `<EEPROM.h>` is the library for accessing the EEPROM memory.
- `<PID_v1.h>` is a library for implementing PID control.

```cpp
#define RELAY_PIN 2
#define BUZZER_PIN 3
#define LED_ACTIVE_PIN 4
#define LED_ALARM_PIN 5
#define BUTTON_UP_PIN 6
#define BUTTON_DOWN_PIN 7
#define BUTTON_SET_PIN 8
#define ONE_WIRE_BUS 9
```
- These are preprocessor directives defining pin numbers for various components connected to the Arduino.

```cpp
double setpoint, input, output;
double Kp = 1, Ki = 0, Kd = 0; // PID constants
PID pid(&input, &output, &setpoint, Kp, Ki, Kd, DIRECT);
```
- These lines declare variables for PID control and instantiate a PID controller object with the specified PID constants.

```cpp
OneWire oneWire(ONE_WIRE_BUS);
DallasTemperature sensors(&oneWire);
```
- These lines instantiate a `OneWire` object for communication with DS18B20 temperature sensors and a `DallasTemperature` object for managing multiple sensors.

```cpp
LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2);
```
- This line initializes an `LiquidCrystal_I2C` object named `lcd`. 
- The parameters are the I2C address of the LCD (0x27), number of columns (16), and number of rows (2).

```cpp
int buttonStateUp = 0;
int buttonStateDown = 0;
int buttonStateSet = 0;
int lastButtonStateSet = 0;
```
- These lines declare variables to store the state of the buttons.

```cpp
void setup() {
```
- This is the start of the setup function, which is called once when the Arduino starts.

```cpp
  pinMode(RELAY_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(BUZZER_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED_ACTIVE_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED_ALARM_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(BUTTON_UP_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(BUTTON_DOWN_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(BUTTON_SET_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);
```
- These lines set the pinMode of the pins used for various components.

```cpp
  lcd.init();
  lcd.backlight();
```
- These lines initialize the LCD display and turn on the backlight.

```cpp
  pid.SetMode(AUTOMATIC);
  pid.SetSampleTime(1000);
  pid.SetOutputLimits(0, 255);
```
- These lines configure the PID controller.

```cpp
  EEPROM.get(0, setpoint);
```
- This line reads the setpoint value from EEPROM memory at address 0.

```cpp
  sensors.begin();
```
- This line initializes the DS18B20 temperature sensors.

```cpp
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
```
- This line initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 9600.

```cpp
void loop() {
```
- This is the start of the loop function, which runs repeatedly.

```cpp
  buttonStateUp = digitalRead(BUTTON_UP_PIN);
  buttonStateDown = digitalRead(BUTTON_DOWN_PIN);
  buttonStateSet = digitalRead(BUTTON_SET_PIN);
```
- These lines read the state of the buttons.

```cpp
  if (buttonStateSet != lastButtonStateSet) {
    if (buttonStateSet == HIGH) {
      setpoint += 0.1;
      EEPROM.put(0, setpoint);
    }
    lastButtonStateSet = buttonStateSet;
  }
```
- This code increments the setpoint by 0.1 when the SET button is pressed, and it saves the new setpoint to EEPROM.

```cpp
  sensors.requestTemperatures();
  float temp1 = sensors.getTempCByIndex(0);
  float temp2 = sensors.getTempCByIndex(1);
  input = (temp1 + temp2) / 2.0;// AVERAGE THE RECORDED VALUE
```
- These lines request and read temperatures from the DS18B20 sensors and calculate the average temperature.

```cpp
  pid.Compute();
```
- This line computes the PID control signal.

```cpp
  if (output > 0) {
    digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(LED_ACTIVE_PIN, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);
    digitalWrite(LED_ACTIVE_PIN, LOW);
  }
```
- These lines activate or deactivate the relay and active LED based on the PID output.

```cpp
  if (input > setpoint) {
    digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(LED_ALARM_PIN, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, LOW);
    digitalWrite(LED_ALARM_PIN, LOW);
  }
```
- These lines activate or deactivate the buzzer and alarm LED based on the temperature exceeding the setpoint.

```cpp
  lcd.clear();
  lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
  lcd.print("Setpoint: ");
  lcd.print(setpoint);
  lcd.print("C");

  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
  lcd.print("Temp: ");
  lcd.print(input);
  lcd.print("C");
```
- These lines clear the LCD display and print the setpoint and temperature values.

```cpp
  delay(1000);
}
```
- This line adds a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) before the loop repeats.
